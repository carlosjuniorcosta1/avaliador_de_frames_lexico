# avaliador_de_frames_lexico
This code uses data taken from C-ORAL-BRASIL (RASO, MELLO, 2012) https://www.c-oral-brasil.org/ or C-ORAL-ESQ (FERRARI, ROCHA, forthcoming), which are oral corpora, and give you a suggestion about the relationship bewtween their lexical units and the more likely frame (http://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br/index.php/webtool/report/frame/main)  they are related to. 

How to use it:
1) You need a csv dataframe built by extrator_1
2) You need the csv frame_net_dados, available in this repository
3) Run the code in your favorite Python environment. I use Colab for this purpose:
